"""
Comprehensive tests for ai/common.py and ai/utils.py

This test suite covers all functions with meaningful Go game scenarios
including capture situations, eye formation, territory disputes, tactical patterns,
and wall generation integration. Uses ASCII art for clear test visualization.

To run the tests:
    cd go && python ai/common_test.py

ASCII Art Notation:
- . = empty space
- # = wall
- X = black stone  
- O = white stone

Test Coverage:
- Core AI functions: capture_move, defend_move, growth_move, etc.
- Eye formation: eye_creation_move, eye_blocking_move, get_all_eyes
- Territory analysis: disputed_territory, get_disputed_territory_moves
- Tactical patterns: pattern_move, expansion_move, jump_move
- Chain analysis: get_all_chains, find_furthest_points_of_chain
- Utility functions: effective_liberties_of_new_move, flood_fill
- Complex scenarios: encirclement detection, neighbor finding
- Wall generation: gen_wall, wall patterns, rotation, board integration
- AI functions with walls: liberty calculation, capture detection, eye formation,
  territory analysis, and pattern matching when walls are present

Features:
- ASCII art board visualization for intuitive test scenarios
- Comprehensive wall integration testing
- Realistic Go game situations and tactical patterns
- Edge case handling and error condition testing

Total: 62 test methods covering 50+ functions including comprehensive wall integration
